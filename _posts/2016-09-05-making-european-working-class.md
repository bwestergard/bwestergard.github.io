# Why these readings?

For the first week of the D.C. _Endnotes_ reading group I suggested we do some background reading on the origins of the European working class, the subject of so much of what will follow. The texts are:

- “Industrialization and the Working Class” and “The Rise of Labor Movements” from Geoff Eley's _Forging Democracy_
- [An excerpt](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/ch02a.htm#469a) from _Results of the Direct Production Process_ by Karl Marx (1864)

I chose the Eley text for the simple reason that the authors of Endnotes  [cite](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/4/en/endnotes-the-fracturing-of-the-workers-movement) it and it forms the backbone of the _[European Socialism and Communism Reader](https://communistresearchcluster.wordpress.com/readers/)_ that _Endnotes_-affiliated persons were among the editors of. I take it that Eley is one influence on the Endnotes telling of the story of the rise and fall of the workers' movement in _[A History of Separation](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/4/en/endnotes-preface)_.

I thought we should read _Results_ for its explication of formal and real subsumption of the labor process by capital. The theory of subsumption makes intelligible the development of distinctively capitalist class structure, the fall of the lord and serf, master and apprentice, landowner and peasant, etc. into the orbit of the capital-relation. Eley says "Industry brought the 'social problem.'" [^socialproblem] Marx explains why this should be so.

Moreover, for Endnotes and their interlocutors, rival conceptions of subsumption are used to justify rival periodizations of the history of socialist and working class movements, and it is to _Results_ (inter alia) that they look for textual warrant:

> In the 1970s — in the midst of the historical break with the programmatic[^programmatism] epoch of class struggle — the concept of “subsumption” emerged in Marxist discourse in the process of a general return to Marx, and in particular to the drafts of Capital. In a moment of rupture, the need to periodise the history of the capitalist class relation was evident. Since the distinction between the “formal” and “real” subsumption of labour under capital — which was prominent in texts of Marx which were only then becoming known — seemed to identify something important about the historical deepening of capitalist relations of production, it provided an obvious starting point for such periodisations. Thus the concept of subsumption was employed not only in the periodisation of TC, but also in those of Jacques Camatte and Antonio Negri — periodisations which often overlap significantly.[^periodize]

In what follows I'll try to provide some interpretive cues for _Results_ drawn largely from a monograph by Patrick Murray[^murray]. It is cited by the above-quoted _Endnotes_ essay, which I'll defer discussion of until the appointed time (Week #3).

# _Results of the Direct Production Process_

_Results_ was intended as "a summary of Volume 1 and as a _bridge_ between Volumes 1 and 2 [of Capital]"[^mandel] (italics original). It is a summary in that it deals with the same subject matter as the "middle third" of Volume 1[^middlethird]: the production of absolute and relative surplus value, which correspond to formal and real subsumption respectively. It sets the stage for Volume II's discussion of the circuits of capital by adumbrating how such circuits could get underway, and in particular how they could incorporate pre-existing labor processes (e.g. those of artisans).

In the first of three sections, _Commodities as the Product of Capital_, as in the Chapter 1 of Volume 1, the commodity is presented as the form of wealth in capitalist societies [^commodityform]. That wealth should take the form of commodities is both a prerequisite and consequence of capitalist production:

> The commodity, as the elementary form of bourgeois wealth, was our starting point, the presupposition for the emergence of capital. On the other hand, commodities now appear as the product of capital.

> This circular course taken by our presentation, on the one hand, corresponds to the historical development of capital, one of the conditions for the emergence of which is the exchange of commodities trade in commodities; but this condition itself is formed on the basis provided by a number of different stages of production which all have in common a situation in which capitalist production either does not as yet exist at all or exists only sporadically. On the other hand, the exchange of commodities in its full development and the form of the commodity as the universally necessary social form of the product first emerge as a result of the capitalist mode of production.

> If, in contrast, we consider societies where capitalist production is fully developed, the commodity appears there as both the constant elementary presupposition of capital and, on the other hand, as the direct result of the capitalist production process.

Commodity production antedates the development of capitalist production but the commodity is not yet the "the general form of all produce" it will become when capitalist production predominates. Murray speaks of the "generalized commodity form" in connection with situations in which this condition obtains.

As an example of this pre-existing commodity production Marx twice refers to the division of agricultural produce into the means of subsistence for the producer and an amount in excess of subsistence need which is sold. Commodity production of this kind is the predominant form when direct producers are not yet dependent on the market. "If, e.g., capital has not yet taken control of agriculture, a large part of the product is still produced directly as means of subsistence, not as commodities; a large part of the working population will not yet have been converted into wage labourers, nor will a large part of the conditions of labour have been converted into capital."

The commodity, an economic category "appropriate to earlier modes of production", acquires a "new and specific historical character under the impact of capitalist production". Production for sale goes from being an incidental ("Well kids, if the harvest is good we might have some corn to sell!") to primary ("We'll hire workers to plant corn if prices don't keep dropping") intention of producers. In the circuit syntax of Vol. 2, the exchange of one commodity for money with which another commodity is purchased (`C-M-C`) is supplanted by exchange of money for means of production and labor power used to produce a commodity chosen so as to engender a sale for more than the cost of the factors of production advanced (`M-C(MP/LP)-P-C'-M'`).

For the production _of commodities_ to proliferate, it must increasingly become production _by means of commodities_. It is only when the worker's ability to work is "converted into a commodity for him"[^forHim] that "production of commodities leads inexorably to capitalist production". Capitalist commodity production inexorably displaces the form commodity production on which it initially depends - that carried out by producers with access to factors of production (e.g. land and their own capacity to labor) independent of market exchange.

The key point of the first section is the historic novelty of the _generalization_ of commodity production. In the second section, _Capitalist Production as the Production of Surplus Value_, it is the historic novelty of the capital-relation that's emphasized. Put another way, Marx is keen to circumscribe the time period to which the concept of capital can be applied without obfuscating social reality.

This position distinguishes him from his contemporaries and the great majority of ours. Here, for instance, is how capital is defined in Samuelson and Nordhaus's wildly popular introductory textbook,   _Economics_:

> An advanced industrial economy like the United States employs a vast array of buildings, machines, computers, software, and so on. These are the factors of production called __capital__ - a produced factor of production, a durable input which is itself an output of the economy. [...]

> Use of capital involves time-consuming, round-about methods of production. People learned long ago that indirect and roundabout production techniques are often more efficient than direct methods of production. For example, the most direct method of catching fish is to wade into a stream and grab fish with your hands, but this yields more frustration than fish. By using a fishing rod (which is capital equipment), fishing time becomes more productive in terms of fish caught per day. By using even more capital, in the form of nets and fishing boats, fishing becomes productive enough to feed many people and provide a good living to those who operate the specialized nets and equipment.

In other words, "capital is wealth capable of being used to produce more wealth" [^wealth2wealth]. The maker and user of capital equipment may be one and the same or they may be distinct, and if distinct, they may stand in any relation whatsoever to one another. A fishing rod I make for my own use is no more or less capital than an Amazon data center. By knapping flints, the early Pleistocene residents of [Olduvai Gorge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_Gorge#Toolmaking) could be said to have been creating some of the first capital equipment, a produced means of flayed carcass production.

- Place of _Results_ in Marx's corpus
  - Bridge between vol. 1 and vol. 2
  - Restatement of vol. 1 (particularly middle third dealing with RSV/ASV)

    - Capital middle third
    - 1861-1863 manuscripts
- Structure of _Results_
  1. Commodities as the product of capital, of capitalist production
    - Commodity both product and pre-req of capitalist production
    - Commodity production predates capitalist mode of production, but "only on the basis of capitalist production does the commodity actually become the _universal elementary form of wealth_. For example, where capital has not yet taken over agriculture, a large proportion of agricultural produce is still used directly as means of subsistence and not as a commodity."
    - social division of labor
  2. Capitalist production is the production of surplus value
  3. Finally, it is the production and reproduction of the whole relation through which this direct production process is characterised as specifically capitalist.

[^programmatism]: "Generally speaking we could say that programmatism is defined as a theory and practice of class struggle in which the proletariat finds, in its drive toward liberation, the fundamental elements of a future social organisation which become the programme to be realised. This revolution is thus the affirmation of the proletariat, whether as a dictatorship of the proletariat, workers’ councils, the liberation of work, a period of transition, the withering of the state, generalised self-management, or a 'society of associated producers'... Programmatism is intrinsically linked to the contradiction between the proletariat and capital as it is constituted by the formal subsumption of labour under capital." - Théorie Communiste, [Much Ado About Nothing](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/1/en/endnotes-much-ado-about-nothing)
