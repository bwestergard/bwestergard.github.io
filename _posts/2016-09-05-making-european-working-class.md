# Why these readings?

For the first week of the D.C. _Endnotes_ reading group I suggested we do some background reading on the origins of the European working class, the subject of so much of what will follow. The texts are:

- “Industrialization and the Working Class” and “The Rise of Labor Movements” from Geoff Eley's _Forging Democracy_
- [An excerpt](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/ch02a.htm#469a) from _Results of the Direct Production Process_ by Karl Marx (1864)

I chose the Eley text for the simple reason that the authors of Endnotes  [cite](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/4/en/endnotes-the-fracturing-of-the-workers-movement) it and it forms the backbone of the _[European Socialism and Communism Reader](https://communistresearchcluster.wordpress.com/readers/)_ that Endnotes-affiliated persons were among the editors of. I take it that Eley is one influence on the Endnotes telling of the story of the rise and fall of the workers' movement in _[A History of Separation](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/4/en/endnotes-preface)_. It's also wonderfully concise.

I chose this excerpt from the _Results_ for its partly historical treatment of formal and real subsumption of the labor process by capital, with the bulk of the text dealing with the former. Whatever else it may be, the story of formal subsumption is the origin story of the proletariat, the fall of the peasant, master, apprentice, slave, etc. into the orbit of the capital-relation. This reading provides a sketch of a pre-history of the industrial working class the full flowering of which is documented by Eley.

But if all we're after is a version of this pre-history, we'd have a much richer one in Part VIII of Capital Vol. 1 ("Primitive Accumulation"). I chose this excerpt because for Endnotes and their interlocutors, rival conceptions of subsumption are used to justify rival periodizations of the history of socialist and working class movements, and these conceptions were justified by reference to (among other texts) the _Results_:

> In the 1970s — in the midst of the historical break with the programmatic[^programmatism] epoch of class struggle — the concept of “subsumption” emerged in Marxist discourse in the process of a general return to Marx, and in particular to the drafts of Capital. In a moment of rupture, the need to periodise the history of the capitalist class relation was evident. Since the distinction between the “formal” and “real” subsumption of labour under capital — which was prominent in texts of Marx which were only then becoming known — seemed to identify something important about the historical deepening of capitalist relations of production, it provided an obvious starting point for such periodisations. Thus the concept of subsumption was employed not only in the periodisation of TC, but also in those of Jacques Camatte and Antonio Negri — periodisations which often overlap significantly.[^periodize]

[^programmatism]: "Generally speaking we could say that programmatism is defined as a theory and practice of class struggle in which the proletariat finds, in its drive toward liberation, the fundamental elements of a future social organisation which become the programme to be realised. This revolution is thus the affirmation of the proletariat, whether as a dictatorship of the proletariat, workers’ councils, the liberation of work, a period of transition, the withering of the state, generalised self-management, or a 'society of associated producers'... Programmatism is intrinsically linked to the contradiction between the proletariat and capital as it is constituted by the formal subsumption of labour under capital." - [Much Ado About Nothing](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/1/en/endnotes-much-ado-about-nothing)

[^periodize]: [_Endnotes #2_: The History of Subsumption](https://endnotes.org.uk/articles/6), to be read for Week #3.
