# Why these readings?

For the first week of the D.C. _Endnotes_ reading group I suggested we do some background reading on the origins of the European working class, the subject of so much of what will follow. The texts are:

- “Industrialization and the Working Class” and “The Rise of Labor Movements” from Geoff Eley's _Forging Democracy_
- [An excerpt](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/ch02a.htm#469a) from _Results of the Direct Production Process_ by Karl Marx (1864)

I chose the Eley text for the simple reason that the authors of Endnotes  [cite](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/4/en/endnotes-the-fracturing-of-the-workers-movement) it and it forms the backbone of the _[European Socialism and Communism Reader](https://communistresearchcluster.wordpress.com/readers/)_ that _Endnotes_-affiliated persons were among the editors of. I take it that Eley is one influence on the Endnotes telling of the story of the rise and fall of the workers' movement in _[A History of Separation](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/4/en/endnotes-preface)_.

I thought we should read _Results_ for its explication of formal and real subsumption of the labor process by capital. The theory of subsumption makes intelligible the development of distinctively capitalist class structure, the fall of the lord and serf, master and apprentice, landowner and peasant, etc. into the orbit of the capital-relation. Eley says "Industry brought the 'social problem.'" [^socialproblem] Marx explains why this should be so.

Moreover, for Endnotes and their interlocutors, rival conceptions of subsumption are used to justify rival periodizations of the history of socialist and working class movements, and it is to _Results_ (inter alia) that they look for textual warrant:

> In the 1970s — in the midst of the historical break with the programmatic[^programmatism] epoch of class struggle — the concept of “subsumption” emerged in Marxist discourse in the process of a general return to Marx, and in particular to the drafts of Capital. In a moment of rupture, the need to periodise the history of the capitalist class relation was evident. Since the distinction between the “formal” and “real” subsumption of labour under capital — which was prominent in texts of Marx which were only then becoming known — seemed to identify something important about the historical deepening of capitalist relations of production, it provided an obvious starting point for such periodisations. Thus the concept of subsumption was employed not only in the periodisation of TC, but also in those of Jacques Camatte and Antonio Negri — periodisations which often overlap significantly.[^periodize]

In what follows I'll try to provide some interpretive cues for _Results_ drawn largely from a monograph by Patrick Murray[^murray]. It is cited by the above-quoted _Endnotes_ essay, which I'll defer discussion of until the appointed time (Week #3).

# _Results of the Direct Production Process_

_Results_ was intended as "a summary of Volume 1 and as a _bridge_ between Volumes 1 and 2 [of Capital]"[^mandel] (italics original). It is a summary in that it deals with the same subject matter as the "middle third" of Volume 1[^middlethird]: the production of absolute and relative surplus value, which correspond to formal and real subsumption respectively. It sets the stage for Volume II's discussion of the circuits of capital by adumbrating how such circuits could get underway, and in particular how existing labor processes could be incorporated by them.

In the first section, _Commodities as the Product of Capital_, the commodity is presented as the form of wealth adequate to capitalist production:

> The commodity, as the elementary form of bourgeois wealth, was our starting point, the presupposition for the emergence of capital. On the other hand, commodities now appear as the product of capital.

> This circular course taken by our presentation, on the one hand, corresponds to the historical development of capital, one of the conditions for the emergence of which is the exchange of commodities trade in commodities; but this condition itself is formed on the basis provided by a number of different stages of production which all have in common a situation in which capitalist production either does not as yet exist at all or exists only sporadically. On the other hand, the exchange of commodities in its full development and the form of the commodity as the universally necessary social form of the product first emerge as a result of the capitalist mode of production.

> If, in contrast, we consider societies where capitalist production is fully developed, the commodity appears there as both the constant elementary presupposition of capital and, on the other hand, as the direct result of the capitalist production process.


- Place of _Results_ in Marx's corpus
  - Bridge between vol. 1 and vol. 2
  - Restatement of vol. 1 (particularly middle third dealing with RSV/ASV)
  - One of three works in which formal/real subsumption are dealt with at length
    - Capital middle third
    - 1861-1863 manuscripts
- Structure of _Results_
  1. Commodities as the product of capital, of capitalist production
    - Commodity both product and pre-req of capitalist production
    - Commodity production predates capitalist mode of production, but "only on the basis of capitalist production does the commodity actually become the _universal elementary form of wealth_. For example, where capital has not yet taken over agriculture, a large proportion of agricultural produce is still used directly as means of subsistence and not as a commodity."
    - social division of labor
  2. Capitalist production is the production of surplus value
  3. Finally, it is the production and reproduction of the whole relation through which this direct production process is characterised as specifically capitalist.
- Key themes
  - Social form of wealth
   - "It is production which is not limited by any predetermining or predetermined barriers set by needs."
  - Subsumption
    - Formal
    - Real
    - Hybrid
    - Ideal
  - Mentality of the new subordinate classes (respectability!)
    - "so the worker is indifferent to the particular content of his labour" (instrumental relation to wage labor)
    - Needs
- Controversies
  - Which kinds of production are the concomitants of which forms of subsumption?
  - Historical/Conceptual
  - What can be subsumed? Labor process, workers, other factors of production, society?
    - "Marx considers the possibility of a distinct historical stage of merely formal subsumption but finds no evidence of one. Neither does Marx think that there is any historical period of ‘simple co-operation’ (454)." - Murray

# _Forging Democracy_

[^socialproblem]: Page 47

[^programmatism]: "Generally speaking we could say that programmatism is defined as a theory and practice of class struggle in which the proletariat finds, in its drive toward liberation, the fundamental elements of a future social organisation which become the programme to be realised. This revolution is thus the affirmation of the proletariat, whether as a dictatorship of the proletariat, workers’ councils, the liberation of work, a period of transition, the withering of the state, generalised self-management, or a 'society of associated producers'... Programmatism is intrinsically linked to the contradiction between the proletariat and capital as it is constituted by the formal subsumption of labour under capital." - Théorie Communiste, [Much Ado About Nothing](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/1/en/endnotes-much-ado-about-nothing)
