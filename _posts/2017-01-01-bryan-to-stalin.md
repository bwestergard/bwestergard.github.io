In _From Bryan To Stalin_ (1937), W.Z. Foster intended "to show those forces which impelled [him], an American worker, to arrive at... revolutionary conclusions, to become a Communist". The bulk of of the book's chapters tell the story of his involvement in a particular political current, strike movement, party, or propaganda group. The activities and political line of the group are summarized, as are Foster's views at the time, followed by a didactic critique of these by the older and wiser Foster of the time of writing.

The impression we're to come away with is of the author as a humble rank-and-filer who, aside from slight precocity on trade union questions, came by his advanced political views through trial and error alongside his fellow American toilers. Bolshevik tutelage of American communists after 1919 is presented as more often than not confirming conclusions arrived at independently.
