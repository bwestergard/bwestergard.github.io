_From Bryan To Stalin_ (1937) makes good on the promise of its title by wending its way from "[free silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_silver)" to the "[People's Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_front#The_Comintern.27s_Popular_Front_policy_1934.E2.80.9339)", recounting the development of both Foster's political views and the institutions of the American working class.
