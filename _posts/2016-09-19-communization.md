# A personal anecdote

[Juan Conatz](https://libcom.org/tags/juan-conatz) was the first person to utter the word "communization" in my presence. We were at a [summer camp](https://libcom.org/library/reviving-old-tradition-educating-iww-agitators-work-peoples-college) for [I.W.W.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWW) members[^IWW] on a campground that had once been owned by Finnish-American communists. Attesting to this past were such relics as a slightly-larger-than-life-sized portrait of Lenin.

The hundred or so assembled "wobblies" were a politically heterogenous bunch, but the majority - or the majority of the bookish types, anyway - would, if asked about their political views, more likely than not have voiced sympathy for "Marxism", "anarchism" "council communism", "syndicalism", "radical unionism", "libertarian socialism", etc. That is to say: not social democracy and not Leninism. These had failed. "Our" predecessors had been righteous and unheeded. When we found Lenin backstage in what had once been a dance hall, we left him there.

The writers Juan was summarizing saw the contending factions of the workers' movement as differing only superficially. Beneath the disagreement, they shared a common worldview, and it was essentially flawed. The programmatic and theoretical differences we of the good left clung to to distinguish ourselves from the bad left were, on their telling of history, quite superficial.

# Readings

For Week #2 of the D.C. _Endnotes_ reading group we decided to just dip our toes into the turbid textual waters of communization theory by reading a few synoptic essays:

- Endnotes - [Foreword to _Issue #1_, "Bring Out Your Dead"](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/1/en/endnotes-bring-out-your-dead)
- Endnotes - [Afterword to _Issue #1_](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/1/en/endnotes-afterword)
- Théorie Communiste - [_Who are we?_](http://libcom.org/library/who-are-we)
- Gilles Dauvé - _[The Story of Our Origins](http://libcom.org/library/the-story-of-our-origins-dauve)_

In Week #10 we'll return to _Endnotes #1_ and the primary sources for the "debate between two French communist groups" summarized in these texts. For now I will, probably foolishly, summarize the summaries.

[^IWW]: I was active in the I.W.W. from roughly 2011 through roughly 2014, attending meetings in D.C., helping the General Executive Board with various I.T. projects, and housing errant members. The project of revitalizing labor movement by disseminating information about what we thought to be superior organizational techniques was one I took very seriously. I (probably uniquely!) saw the IWW as essentially a [dual-unionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_unionism)-friendly version of [Labor Notes](http://www.labornotes.org/) with better hymns, drawing on a councilist/syndicalist patrimony rather than a Trotskyist one. I learned something about the heterogeneity of contemporary work experience, the romantic adventure of workplace conspiracy, and the extraordinarily long odds faced by even the most savvy union activists in the most congenial environments. Eventually, I couldn't make sense of what we were doing, much less my role in it, so I left. Nevertheless, I wish those who remain well.
