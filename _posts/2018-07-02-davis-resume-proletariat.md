title: 'A Résumé for the Proletariat by Mike Davis'

The titular essay of Mike Davis\' new book [*Old Gods, New Enigmas*](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2779-old-gods-new-enigmas) is
ludicrously ambitious in its scope and concision. I\'d recommend it to anyone looking to get the biggest of big picture views of the working class in its heroic era.

It contains two passes over the history of the European and American working classes between 1838 and 1921 - its institutions, its doctrines, its battles, its sub- and counter-cultures, and its geographic distribution at various scales.

In the first pass of only a few hundred words, he offers a rough
political periodization of that interval. In the second, he puts forward
a number theses about this working class organized under thematic
headings and elaborated upon at length.

I\'ve excerpted the theses below. Here is how Davis sets the stage for
them:

> Although everyone agrees that proletarian agency is at the very core
> of revolutionary doctrine, one searches in vain for any expanded
> definition, much less canonical treatment. For this reason, \[Old
> Gods, New Enigmas\] adopts an indirect strategy: a parallel reading of
> Marx\'s *Collected Works* and dozens of studies of European and U.S.
> Labor history in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.
>
> ...\[Old Gods, New Enigmas\] makes no pretense of being an orthodox
> exercise in Marxology or a rigorous attempt to deduce the
> determinations of \[proletarian\] agency from the unfinished opus of
> *Capital* - something I regard as impossible. Rather, I make sweeping,
> even promiscuous use of Lukacsian extrapolation to propose a
> *historical sociology* conforming to the ideal-type of a socialist
> working class in the era of the First and Second Internationals. In
> particular, I mine our current understanding of nineteenth and early
> twentieth-century working-class history - the fruit of hundreds if not
> thousands of studies since 1960 - to highlight the conditions and
> forms of struggle through which class capacities were created and the
> socialist project organized itself. Against the simplistic idea (not
> held by Marx) that socialist consciousness and the power to change
> history principally emerge from the economic class struggle, I stress
> the *overdeterminations* (for instance, of wage struggles by movements
> for suffrage and vice versa) that Rosa Luxemburg, in her brilliant
> analyses of the \'mass strike\', identified as the most potent
> generators of class consciousness and revolutionary will. \[...\]
>
> This reconstruction, moreover is desired primarily as a comparative
> matrix for thinking about agency in the radically changed conditions
> of contemporary class conflict, and it saves for a future work any
> consideration of the classical counter-arguments against revolutionary
> agency the most compelling of which were probably Werner Sombart\'s
> *Why There is No Socialism in the United States* (1906) and Robert
> Michel\'s *Political Parties: A Sociological Study of Oligarchical
> Tendencies of Modern Democracy* (1911). I propose, in other words, an
> idealized, *maximum* argument - presented in the form of theses - for
> the traditional working class as the grave-digger of capitalism.
> Imagine, if you will, the proletariat being asked by the World Spirit
> for a resume of its qualifications for the job of Universal
> Emancipator.

This effort to put together a \"balance sheet\" for the workers\'
movement recalls [A History of
Separation](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/4/en/endnotes-preface) (2015)
by the *Endnotes* editorial collective, for whom Davis\' *Planet
of Slums* (2006) was [a key
text](https://endnotes.org.uk/issues/2/en/endnotes-misery-and-debt).
Davis\' theses are an effort to articulate what *Endnotes* called the
political \"horizon\" of the old workers\' movement. Like *Endnotes*,
Davis draws on Geoff Eley\'s *Forging Democracy* to relate the stories
of women struggling outside factory gates.

Theses
======

Radical Chains
--------------

1.  The modern proletariat, in the words of the \"1844 Introduction,\"
    wears \"radical chains\". Its emancipation rquirs the abolition of
    private property and the eventual disappearance of classes.
2.  Marx makes a central but often ovelooked distinction between
    wage-labor in the broadest sense and highly socialized factory labor
    employed in machine-dominated production. The labor movement in the
    nineteenth century was the protest of the stricken world of the hand
    worker as much as the brave new world of the factory proletariat.
3.  In *The Poverty of Philosophy (1847)*, Marx used the examples of
    England and Chartism to portray the homogenization of proletarian
    life under industrial capital, and, parallel with this, the
    development through struggle of an increasingly united and
    class-conscious labor movement. The picture of class formation in
    *Capital*, however, is far more complex, with economic growth
    producing a heterogeneous working class whose modern core of factory
    workers and miners is surrounded by a penumbra of construction and
    transport workers, farm and sweatshop workers, service and office
    employees and staggering numbers of domestic servants.
4.  The Industrial Revolution and its subordination of the producer to
    the machine created a new historical subject, the \"collective
    worker\"; a new form of exploitation, relative surplus extraction;
    and a new terrain of class struggle, mass production.
5.  If poverty, as Andre Gorz claimed, is the \"natural basis\" of the
    struggle for socialism, it is the \"unnatural poverty\" of the
    industrial working class, which grows in lockstep with the
    productive powers of collective labor. Workers, espescially in boom
    periods, may win significant wage improvements that foster the
    growth of new \"necessities\", but they are likely to be reversed
    during downturns. It is not progressive impoverishment - the
    so-called \"law of absolute immiseration\" - that usually generates
    revolutionary impulses but mass unemployment and the sudden loss of
    hard-won and apparently permanent gains.

Factories and Unions
--------------------

1.  The factory system organizes the workforce as interdependent
    collectivities that, through struggle and conscious organization,
    can become communities of solidarity. Moreover, factories and other
    large industrial enterprises such as shipyards and railroad repair
    shops are miniature political systems.
2.  Organizing campaigns and strikes have a politico-moral momentum that
    necessarily exceeds the economic demands that were their first
    cause. Marx was insistent on this point. Moreover, \"as schools of
    war\", Engeles added, \"the Unions are unexcelled\".
3.  In an era of family upheaval and household recomposition, gender
    equality was often the most difficult solidarity to achieve inside
    factories and other modern workplaces. Together with white
    supremacy, patriarchy was the true Achilles\' heel of the labor
    movement.
4.  \"Was Fourier wrong\", asks Marx rhetorically in *Capital*, \"when
    he called factories \'mitigated jails\'?\" Resistance to workplace
    despotism (i.e. disciplinary codes, arbitrary powers of overseers,
    firings without cause, sexual harassment, and so on) has always been
    the pilot light of the modern class struggle. By fighting to
    establish rights on the factory floor, workers challenged not merely
    \"managerial prerogative\", but implicity challenged the principle
    of wage-labor itself.
5.  The path from the anomic, internally divided factory to workforce
    solidarity and the successful exercise of shopfloor power did not
    always follow the narrative of heroic union-building. Where workers
    were less replacable because of special demographic or labor-market
    conditions, conflict inside the factory might be more informally,
    even invisibly organized.
6.  Proletarianization in late-developing nations was sometimes and
    explosive process that transferred the raw countryside to the
    factory without any urban acclimation. Russia was the classic case
    of such \"non-linear\" proletarianization, and its young peasant
    workers often combined impressive shopfloor militancy with the most
    backward rural prejudices.

Mass Strikes and Workers\' Control
----------------------------------

1.  As industrial capitalism grew both domestically and through world
    markets, strategically emplaced workers gained unprecedented power
    to non-violently disrupt economic activity, and even to hold hostage
    the means of production. Neither capital nor labor, however, knew
    the limits of this power, or, on the part of the latter, to what
    extremes of force owners might resort when confront with its full
    exercise. The general strike was the late Victorian and Edwardian
    proletariat\'s \"atomic bomb\".
2.  As these mass strikes revealed, the deep structure of the workers\'
    movement, beyond its visible official institutions and affiliates,
    was the unofficial often non-party organization of struggle within
    the factories, mines, and merchat marines. These internal networks
    allowed shopfloor workers to mount informal actions and, in periods
    of defeat and repression, to preserve their culture of militancy.
3.  Workers can run the factories and develop the forces of production.
    Until the First World War, much of the applied science of production
    remain the quasi-property of metalworkers and other craftsmen.
4.  In the European Revolution of 1917-21, metalworkers based in the
    giant wartime munitions plants and shipyards led the rank-and-file
    labor revolt against war and immiseration. Faced with the rapid
    declien of craft regulation of production, an important cohort of
    the \"aristocracy of labor\", organized across Europe in ad hoc shop
    stewards\' movement, embraced a radical program of workers\' control
    of the factories.
5.  The factory council movement synthesized two previously divergent
    strands of labor struggle: the semi-skilled workers\' quest for
    inclusive industrial representation, and the metal crafts\' defense
    of their prerogatives within the labor process. The small Owenite
    experiments in industrial self-management that Marx had praised
    fifty years earlier had now grown into a sweeping concept of
    workers\' control of the entire industrial economy.

The Industrial City
-------------------

1.  Union militancy often attained its highest development in pit
    villages and textile towns, but socialism is ultimately the child of
    the cities: those graveyards of paternalism and religious belief. In
    the cities, a broad proletarian public sphere could flourish.
2.  The propiniquity of work and residence, which ensured that
    industrial struggles spilled over into neighborhoods and vice versa,
    was a powerful support to class consciousness. This nexus was
    perpetuated, even strengthened, in early industrial suburbs of which
    Paris provided the most vivid examples.
3.  Hundreds of factory towns and industrial suburbs in Europe and the
    United States put socialists in city hall after 1890. They led
    important fights against the emerging electric power and traction
    trusts, and in some notable cases (Los Angeles, for examples)
    replaced private monopolies with public utilities. In other cases,
    Socialist majorites in local government were crucial to protecting
    the rights to strike and protest, as well as limiting the
    strike-breaking role of the police. But \"municipalism\" - the
    Fabian belief that important reforms could be achieved by
    progressive government at the local level - too often degenerated
    into \"sewer socialism\", which differed only marginally from
    middle-class reform movements with which it was frequently allied.
4.  Before the 1930s and the great victories of the CIO in the United
    States (a template for postwar unionism in Europe), the city itself
    provided the principal form or shell for the economic, as well as
    political and cultural, organization of the working class across
    craft boundaries. Great class battles, with the exceptions of miners
    and railroad workers were conducted by urban labor federations, or
    alternately the union-managed, muncipally funded *bourses* and
    *camere del lavoro* that, from the 1890s, were the nuclei of worker
    mulitancy in France, Italy, and to a lesser extent Spain.
5.  Urban class struggles, espescially those adressing emergencies of
    shelter, food, and fuel, were typically led by working-class
    mothers, the forgotten heroes of socialist history.
6.  In response to the high cost of living in the great urban
    agglomerations, workers, inspired by the Rochdale Pioneers in
    Lancashire, organized their own cooperative stores, believing they
    were taking the first steps into a socialist future.
7.  Although Marx wrote little or nothing on the housing crisis, and
    Engels pointedly dismissed proffered solutions as utopian, rewnt
    gouging amidst a universal lack of affordable shelter was a central
    grievance of the urban working classes everywhere. By 1915,
    moreover, the rent strike had become a familiar weapon in the class
    arsenal and played an important role in fermenting revolts against
    the war.

Proletarian Culture
-------------------

1.  Within this urban matrix, already richly endowed with artisan
    traditions, a proletarian public sphere developed. The ideas of
    socialism (or anarcho-communism) became embodied in well-organized
    counter-cultures that projected the solidarities of the workplace
    and neighborhood into all aspects of recreation, education, and
    culture.
2.  The alternative organization of urban daily life, however, was not
    limited to the contestation of bourgeois values and institutions or
    to the self-organization of important cultural and social services,
    but aspired to educate a new socialist humanity.
3.  A proletarian public sphere, of course, depended upon the existence
    of spaces for meetings, classes, agitation and recreation. Even in
    countries where the labor movement was legal, it sometimes required
    a long fight to create such spaces at the neighborhood level.
4.  The ultimate symbol of proletarian life in most cities (and later,
    the chief target of fascist atttack) was the *maison du peuple, casa
    del popolo, Volkshaus*, or labor temple.
5.  The generational stratification of the working class, like gender
    and skill divisions, was a source of both internal conflict and
    creative energy. After 1905 the so-called \"Young Guard\" movements
    led the revolt of a third generation fo worker socialists against
    the reformist, evolutionist policies of second-generation political
    and union leadewrs. Attracted to syndicalist and maximalist
    positions, and wholeheartedly anti-militarist, the younger cohort
    was accused by its elders of embracing a \"socialism of the Dream\".
    In fact, the youth movements incubated the future leadership of
    European Communism.
6.  \"Sport is a chain-breaker for the youth of the proletariat, a
    liberator from physical and spiritual slavery\". By the turn of the
    century, arugably no cultural contestation between classes was more
    important than working-class sports. Here were fought key battles
    over militarism, mass culture, and the allegiances of working-class
    youth.
7.  Reading \"ignited insurrections in the minds of workers\". The
    largely successful struggle for working-class literacy in the
    nineteenth century, accompanied by a technological revolution in the
    print media, brought the world - as news, literature, science or
    simply sensation - into the daily routine of the proletariat. The
    rapid growth of the labor and socialist press in the last quarter of
    the century nourished an increasingly sophisticated political world
    view.
8.  The proletariat, no the bourgeoisie, is the ultimate \"bearer of
    modern culture\". Its enthusiasm for science, in particular,
    confirmed its future as a hegemonic class.

Class Struggle and Hegemony
---------------------------

1.  \"Classes\", said Edward Thompson in a famous article, \"do not
    exist as separate entities... class-struggle is the prior, as well
    as the more universal, concept\". Class struggle is shaped by and,
    in turn, reshapes its objective conditions: a process that often
    resembles an extended arms race. Indeed, we need only add the past
    tense to Regis Debray\'s description of the dialectic of guerilla nd
    anti-guerilla warfare: \"the Revolution revolutionizes the
    Counter-Revolution\" (and vice versa).
2.  The workers\' movement can and must confront the power of capital in
    every aspect of social life, organizing resistance on the terrains
    of the economic, the political, the urban, the social-reproductive,
    and the associational. It is the fusion or synthesis of these
    struggles, rather than their simple addition, which invests the
    proletariat with hegemonic consciousness.
3.  In the battle for societal leadership, the workers\' movement must
    speak not only the language of scientific socialism but also the
    dialectics of past popular struggles. Language does not
    \"construct\" the class struggle in any ontological sense (as
    devotees of the \"lingustic turn\" seem to believe), but it is a
    crucial battleground for competing claims of historical and moral
    legitimacy.
4.  Political and economic class struggles, of course, had different
    \"gear ratios\" and velocities in diverse sectors, regions, and
    nations. What synchronized them as a single movement was the
    universal demand for an eight-hour working day. May day was truly
    the foundation of the Socialist International.
5.  To truly embody a general interest, the workers\' movement had to
    assemble a \"historic bloc\" of allied oppressed groups, including
    the rural poor. Indeed the \"agrarian question\" - different in
    every country - was the Rubicon that socialism had to cross in order
    to attain a political and social majority everywhere except in
    England. The fate of the European Revolution of 1917-21 was
    ultimately determined in the countryside.
6.  For revolution to become a possibility, the workers\' movement had
    to break the military monoply of the bourgeois state from the
    inside. Socialist youth organizations, as we have seen, were the
    principal force contesting conscription and, on occasion,
    propagandizing anti-militarist ideas within the barracks. But the
    weakest liunk in wartime was the navy, where the great dreadnaughts
    and battle curisers were little more than \"floating factories\"
    manned by slave labor.

Class Consciousness and Socialism
---------------------------------

1.  Because of its position in social production and the universality of
    its objective interests, the proletariat possesses a superior
    \"epistemological capacity\" to see the economy as a whole, and
    unravel the mystery of capital\'s apparent self-movement (Lukacs\'s
    theses).
2.  A revolutionary collective will is crystallized (and \"correct
    courses of action\" decided upon) primarily through rude, direct
    democracy in periods of extreme mass activity. Class consciousness
    is not the party program, but rather the synthesis of lessons
    learned in protracted class war.
3.  Thanks to the world market and mass emigration, the industrial
    proletariat is objectively constituted as an international class
    with common interests that cross national and ethnic boundaries.
    Great international campaigns, moreover, crystallize the
    proletariat\'s understanding of its world-historical vocation.
4.  The ground condition for the socialist project is the realm of
    freedom immanent in the advanced industrial economy itself. To
    achieve the principal goal of socialism - the transformation of
    surplus labor into equally distributed free time - radical chains
    must be translated into radical needs.
5.  Socialism is economic democracy, exercised at a plurality of levels.
    but the practicalities of workers\' control over their factories and
    workshops (the goal and praxis of revolutionary syndicalism) must be
    distinguished from the incomparably greater challenges of national
    economic planning.
6.  By the outbreak of the First World War, several advanced economies
    had achieved thresholds of industrial productivity and net national
    income that satisfied the minimal conditions for \"socialist
    affluence\" and the gradual conversion of surplus into free time.
    Furthermore, \"state capitalism\", as modeled by the American and
    German war economies of 1918, demonstrated new possibilities for
    allocating investment and resources through central state planning -
    a development whose significance was most keenly grasped by Lenin.
    But the communications and control technologies required for broad
    democratic participation in economic decision-making did not exist,
    and would not be created until the end of the twentieth century.
7.  Labor *must* rule because the bourgeoisie is ultimately unable to
    fulfill the promises of progress. If the social project is defeated
    it will be the retrogression of civilization as a whole.
