I'm Bj√∂rn Westergard, a 27-year-old software developer and resident of Washington, D.C. I'm interested in the political ramifications of the changing character of work.

The title of this blog is a reference to the political economist [David Ricardo's discussion](http://www.econlib.org/library/Ricardo/ricP7.html#31.1) of "the influence of machinery on the interests of the different classes of society". His conclusion, "that the substitution of machinery for human labour, is often very injurious to the interests of the class of labourers", holds true today, however much the machines in question, the nature of the injuries sustained, and structure of classes involved have changed.

This site is a place to collect my notes on this - admittedly very broad - topic, which I plan to approach through readings in the [philosophy of technology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/technology/) (with an emphasis on [software](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computer-science/)), [labor process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_process_theory), and ["value-form"](https://viewpointmag.com/2013/10/21/between-marx-marxism-and-marxisms-ways-of-reading-marxs-theory/)-centric readings of Marx.

The first series of notes I'll post here will be on the idiosyncratically ultra-left communist journal _[Endnotes](https://endnotes.org.uk/about)_, which I'll be reading with [a group](http://dc-endnotes.tumblr.com/).
